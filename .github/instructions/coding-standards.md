# Coding Standards for Agentic Development

## 1. Core Coding Standards (Language-Agnostic)
- Apply SOLID, DRY, and KISS principles in all code, regardless of language.
- Design APIs and interfaces before implementation (API-first).
- Keep files small and modular: refactor at 300+ lines and never exceed 500 lines per file (except for generated codeâ€”files created automatically by tools, such as API stubs, ORM models, or build outputs, which are exempt from these limits).
- Use descriptive, consistent naming for variables, functions, and files.
- Handle errors explicitly and fail fast; never ignore errors.
- Validate all inputs and never hardcode secrets or credentials.
- Write clear, minimal comments; prefer self-documenting code.
- Ensure all code is covered by automated tests; aim for high coverage.
- All changes must be reviewed before merging.
- Refactor functions/methods at 40+ lines; never exceed 50 lines. Each function should have a single responsibility.
- Code reviews must reject changes that violate these limits.

## 2. Security & Privacy
- Follow least privilege and secure-by-default principles.
- Never commit secrets, credentials, or sensitive data.
- Sanitize and validate all external input.
- Review for security issues before committing or merging.

## 3. Documentation & Readability
- Keep documentation concise and relevant.
- Update documentation if code changes affect usage, architecture, or workflows.
- Prefer clarity and maintainability over cleverness.

## 4. Agentic Coding Best Practices
- Propose a plan and wait for user confirmation before implementation.
- Keep changes small, incremental, and reviewable.
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements are ambiguous.

## 6. Linting & Formatting
- All code must pass automated linting and be auto-formatted before review. Use project-standard tools for each language.

## 7. Dependency Management
- Use the latest stable versions of dependencies unless there is a documented reason to pin to an older version.
- Regularly review and update dependencies to ensure security and compatibility.
- Document and justify any new third-party dependency or version pinning in the PR or commit message. Avoid unnecessary dependencies.

## 8. Comments & Public APIs
- All public functions, classes, and exported APIs must have clear docstrings or comments describing their purpose and usage.

## 9. Refactoring & Technical Debt
- Flag and, when possible, address technical debt or code smells as part of your workflow. Leave TODOs with context if immediate refactor is not possible.

## 10. Accessibility & Internationalization (if relevant)
- For UI code, follow accessibility (WCAG) and i18n/l10n best practices where applicable.
