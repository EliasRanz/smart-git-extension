# Smart Git Extension

A comprehensive VS Code extension that enhances Git workflows with intelligent features including AI-powered commit messages, atomic commits, git tree visualization, and advanced Git operations.

## Features

### ðŸ¤– Smart Commits

- **Atomic Commit Selection**: Choose specific files with checkboxes for precise commits
- **Diff Integration**: Click files to view git diffs in VS Code's built-in viewer
- **Multiple AI Strategies**: Uses GitHub Copilot, intelligent analysis, or rule-based fallbacks

### ðŸŒ³ Enhanced Git Views
- **Smart Changes View**: Tree view of changed files organized by repository
- **Git Tree View**: Coming soon - IntelliJ-style commit history and branch visualization
- **Clean Interface**: Minimal, distraction-free UI focused on productivity

### âš¡ Intelligent Workflows

- **Team Integration**: Shared commit conventions and workflows

## Usage

1. **View Changed Files**: The extension automatically shows a clean tree view of changed files in your workspace
2. **Select Files**: Use checkboxes to select which files to include in your commit (atomic commits)
3. **View Diffs**: Click on any file to see its git diff in the main editor
4. **Generate Commit Message**: 
   - âœ… **Select the specific files** you want to commit using checkboxes
   - Open the commit panel in the Smart Git sidebar
   - Click "Generate with AI" 
   - The extension analyzes **only the selected files' diffs** and creates a conventional commit message
5. **Commit**: Review the message and commit your changes
6. **Explore Git Tree**: Coming soon - visualize your Git history like in IntelliJ IDEA

## AI Integration

The extension uses multiple approaches for intelligent commit message generation:

1. **GitHub Copilot**: Uses VS Code's Language Model API silently (if Copilot is available)
2. **Intelligent Analysis**: Analyzes diff patterns and file types to generate smart messages
3. **Rule-Based Fallback**: Uses pattern matching for reliable results

**Important**: The AI analysis works **only on the files you select** with checkboxes, ensuring atomic commits with relevant commit messages.

All approaches generate messages in conventional commit format:
- `feat(scope): description` - New features
- `fix(scope): description` - Bug fixes  
- `docs(scope): description` - Documentation
- `refactor(scope): description` - Code refactoring
- `test(scope): description` - Tests
- `chore(scope): description` - Maintenance

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run compile` to build the extension
